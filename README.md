### GSEA-based Programs for NGS data
#### This repository contains Python programs and example input files to reproduce the GSEA-based approach for gene identification, verification, and comparison presented in the Park & Harris paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8342995/). 
#### Required dependencies: numpy, pandas, scipy, and gseapy (https://gseapy.readthedocs.io/)
#### Limitations of these programs include:
#### 1) Manual preparation of input files to ensure consistent use of gene identifiers (_e.g._, probes, gene symbols, etc.) across all datasets
#### 2) Manual identification of column index for selected samples
#### 3) No GUI = manual manipulation of variable and/or file names marked by the "#change as needed" comment in the code
